# Java-Programming

This is my Java programming lab

```Bash
java --version
```

If you haven't installed java then write down the following code to install java in your arch linux system

```Bash
sudo pacman -S jdk-openjdk
```

Now, you have successfully installed java

```
#setup java virtual machine
sudo archlinux-java set java-17
#you can choose your version , I've choosen mine
```

Yay!  
you are now in java environment!
